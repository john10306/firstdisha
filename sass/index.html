                As part of the mechanical engineering team, I am working on the product development of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle. We are designing various units of the AUV and running simulations for safety management on each component of the AUV. We are working with SolidWorks to design and assemble the modules, and completing finite element analysis after designing the pieces.</p>
            <p>
                I truly enjoy this internship because I can apply my theoretical knowledge in the practical field, gaining hands-on experience. Part of the job is innovating existing designs, checking stability with physical experiments as well as FEA. Safety is one of the main concerns, especially since we are quickly finalizing designs and manufacturing our own components. My responsibilities include ordering parts based on the design, balancing quality and cost. I have also assembled Sherline Mill 2000 and learnt a lot during the process, such as its dependency software Mach3. Since no one in our team was familiar with Mach3, I researched and taught myself with assistance from another team member. Eventually, we manufactured our first part using Sherline Mill, which was an amazing experience. I look forward to becoming familiar with machine learning and continuing to improve my manufacturing skills.</p>
